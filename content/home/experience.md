  **Perception and Goal-directed Manipulation by Object Affordance:**
  * Propose a new representation named Affordance Coordinate Frame that is both perceivable and executable of category-level object affordances.
  * Design CNNs to learn Affordance Coordinate Frame from RGB-D images in heavy clutter, and action primitives for completing specific tasks.

  **Chinese Speech Separation System:**
  * Adopted the convolution method to conduct super-resolution reconstruction of sound signals in the time domain, which is aimed to increase the resolution of the phone recording from 8k to 16k.
  * Used Bi-LSTM network to generate its mask and used the A3C algorithm to improve the separation effect, solving the problem of voices overlap in the telephone record.
  * Evaluate the quality of output audio by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The aforementioned model of audio super-resolution has a higher SNR than the current, best-performing algorithm. The rewards of the A3C algorithm have displayed an upward trend, which means that reinforcement learning using speech processing is feasible.
